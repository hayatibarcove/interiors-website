# Section Rendering Fix

## Issue Description

The rest of the sections (About, Services, etc.) were not rendering properly after the performance optimizations. The problem was caused by several issues:

1. **Fixed Container Height**: The BookAnimation component had a fixed height of `600vh` which was taking up too much space
2. **ContactSection Visibility**: The ContactSection had inline styles that were preventing it from being visible
3. **ScrollTrigger Conflicts**: Multiple ScrollTrigger instances were being killed indiscriminately
4. **Pin Spacing**: The `pinSpacing: false` setting was preventing subsequent content from being pushed down

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Container Height Issue**

**Problem**: BookAnimation container was `600vh` tall, preventing other sections from being visible.

**Solution**: Reduced container height to `2 * window.innerHeight` and updated ScrollTrigger end position to match.

```typescript
// Before
height: "600vh";

// After
const containerHeight = window.innerHeight * 2;
height: `${containerHeight}px`;
```

### 2. **Fixed ContactSection Visibility**

**Problem**: ContactSection had inline styles that were overriding GSAP animations.

**Solution**: Removed the problematic inline styles.

```typescript
// Before
style={{
  opacity: 0,
  visibility: 'hidden',
  pointerEvents: 'none'
}}

// After
style={{
  pointerEvents: 'none'
}}
```

### 3. **Fixed ScrollTrigger Cleanup**

**Problem**: All ScrollTriggers were being killed, preventing other sections from having their animations.

**Solution**: Made cleanup more selective to only kill book-related ScrollTriggers.

```typescript
// Before
ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach((trigger) => trigger.kill());

// After
ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach((trigger) => {
  if (
    trigger.vars.id === "book-animation" ||
    trigger.vars.trigger === containerRef.current ||
    trigger.vars.trigger === bookContainerRef.current
  ) {
    trigger.kill();
  }
});
```

### 4. **Enabled Pin Spacing**

**Problem**: `pinSpacing: false` was preventing subsequent content from being pushed down.

**Solution**: Changed to `pinSpacing: true` to allow proper spacing.

```typescript
// Before
pinSpacing: false;

// After
pinSpacing: true; // Enable pin spacing to push subsequent content down
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/BookAnimation.tsx`**

   - Reduced container height from `600vh` to `2 * window.innerHeight`
   - Updated ScrollTrigger end position to match container height
   - Made ScrollTrigger cleanup more selective
   - Enabled pin spacing

2. **`src/components/ContactSection.tsx`**

   - Removed inline styles that were preventing visibility
   - Kept only necessary styles for proper functionality

3. **`src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Added debugging to check section visibility
   - Added test section to verify rendering

## Testing

- Added debugging console logs to check section visibility
- Added a test section with red background to verify sections after Portfolio are visible
- Console logs will show if sections are rendering and their computed styles

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

- ✅ About section should be visible before the book animation
- ✅ Services section should be visible before the book animation
- ✅ Portfolio section should contain the book animation
- ✅ Test section should be visible after the book animation
- ✅ Contact section should be visible during book animation
- ✅ All sections should have proper spacing and layout

## Performance Impact

These fixes maintain all the performance optimizations while resolving the rendering issues:

- GPU acceleration still enabled
- DOM caching still in place
- Debounced callbacks still working
- Single master ScrollTrigger still used
- Performance monitoring still active

The fixes only address the layout and visibility issues without affecting the performance improvements.
